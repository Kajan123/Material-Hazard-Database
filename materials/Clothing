Clothes release toxic gas when they decompose in landfills. As clothing joins the rest of the garbage in landfills, it breaks down and releases toxic greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the environment. The environmental impact of jeans is high. In every stage of the production there are quite a heavy environmental burden. In cotton production large amounts of water, fertilizers and pesticides are used. The amount of water for irrigation can be as high as 25.000 liter per kg of cotton produced.
Instead of throwing clothes out when they are no longer in use, look at the condition of the clothes and consider if donation is an option. Many charity stores and organizations will accept clothes in good condition, which has a positive effect on the environment by preventing more items from being thrown out for no reason.
