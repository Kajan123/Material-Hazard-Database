Spray paint can have a largely negative impact in terms of air quality due to the materials used in the paint. Many paints are toxic and contain flammable compounds which end up polluting the nearby atmosphere if not properly used. Anything painted should be properly coated afterwards to prevent paint chips falling off overtime. If a full or half-full spray can is dumped into a body of water, chemicals and materials within the paint will quickly spread out.
When in use, it’s important to have proper ventilation (such as painting outdoors or using a large fan) to prevent the inhalation of the fumes. As mentioned above, it’s important to never store them in an overly-warm environment before use.
Spray paints and aerosol propellants should be used with caution. The MSDS states that the substance is extremely flammable. Repeated exposure may cause skin dryness or cracking. Vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. Irritating to eyes. Some paints also contain substances which can impair fertility, and medical attention is needed if a user inhales the substance.
