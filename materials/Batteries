Lead-Acid batteries are dangerous and contain a fair amount of lead which is highly toxic. If released into the environment the chemicals can impact the soil as well as our water supplies which can cause severe damage to us. In some third world countries these batteries are recycled in unsafe areas and where the fumes from the processes are released into the air which can affect local population. Since these people don't have much money they don't have PPE. 
Used Lead-Acid Batteries are often traded in for new batteries. The used batteries then are recycled. The process is done by breaking down the battery at which point the 3 separate pieces “Lead, acid, and plastic” are melted and reused. The acid is neutralized and can also be reused. 
Lead-Acid batteries are a highly toxic item when exposed to humans and then environment and are a hassle to recycle because of the tedious process. The best way to solve this would be to get rid of this item all together and use a more eco-friendly battery. While handling this battery protective gloves and goggles should be worn. Hands should also be washed after handling.
