 Styrofoam has an ingredient called styrene which is a possible carcinogen that can cause respiratory problems and skin irritation. Styrofoam is an expensive item to recycle so it usually ends up in landfills.Over time it breaks into small pieces which end up in the environment and remain there for hundreds of years. These pieces can also be ingested my animals and harm their health. Some styrofoam is also burned which sends toxic fumes and has a negative impact on the ozone layer. 
The best way to solve this issue would be just to not use styrofoam because it is a single use item that cannot even be recycled sustainably. As consumers we can boycott products packaged in styrofoam. 
This material is listed as non-hazardous although it can cause irritation if a powder form is in contact with the skin or eyes. If material is exposed to eyes or skin flush and wash with water and soap. If material adheres to skin or is inhaled and symptoms develop or persist consult a medical professional.
