Compounds of lead stay in water for a long amount of time, and have a half-life greater than 200 days. Because of this, improper handling of lead can cause severe cases of lead poisoning during continued exposure. Most lead paints were banned outright because of how impactful they are towards human health. It has the potential to damage bones, immune systems, the heart, and more. Lead was mostly used in the construction of older buildings (pre-1978), especially with water pipes and paint.
Avoid contact with eyes and skin. Area should be properly ventilated to prevent the inhalation of fumes, and wearing gloves or masks may be necessary if exposure is continued. Ignoring these precautions could lead to lead poisoning. 
This lead paint contains a much smaller amount of lead than the ones created in the 1960’s and 70’s. As a result, while handling of this paint is not as dangerous as older materials, precautions still need to be taken to prevent lead poisoning after prolonged exposure. Once the painting process is complete, excess paint chips should be properly disposed of, and the surrounding area should be cleaned before the paint is returned to storage.
