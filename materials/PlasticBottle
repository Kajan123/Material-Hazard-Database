Plastic bottles can take upwards of 450 years to decompose in landfills. During this time plastic bottles buried in landfills can leach chemicals into the ground which can spread into groundwater. Piles of plastic also end up in the ocean which can poison and injure marine life, disrupt habitats and carry invasive species. 
To prevent large amounts of plastic ending up in our environment we can entirely ban single use plastics and make it a requirement for companies to manage their waste sustainably and dispose of them in a safe manner.
91% of plastic does not end up being recycled. This large quantity of plastic bottles mainly end up in landfills and oceans. The remaining percentage is recycled and converted into raw material.
