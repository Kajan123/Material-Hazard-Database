Copper compounds can cause negative ecological effects to aquatic life forms if dumped into water. E-Waste is also a very large source of pollution in modern times, with many retired or unusable pieces of technology being shipped to third-world countries where they are disassembled and stripped for precious materials. From here, the remaining toxic materials leak into the water and food systems, causing a largely negative effect on humans and animals near it. 
Always wear non-conductive articles of clothing when working with copper or similar metals (gloves, goggles if large amounts are being handled, etc.) If the copper is being used in an electrical device, ensure that the device is off before starting to adjust or modify it.
Proper ventilation should be used to prevent fumes from being inhaled, and non-conductive clothing should be worn when working with electronics to prevent an electrical shock.
