Bubble wrap does not do as much harm as other plastics. Depending on the bubble wrap purchased it can affect the environment good or bad. Make sure the bubble wrap purchased is polyethylene as some used to be made with plastic polymer film which increases toxic waste 
When using it’s best used on less heavier objects . Tiny bubbles pop easier whereas bigger bubbles have more restraint. Make sure it’s the right size of bubble wrap used for packaging items so it can protect the item better when transported 
Consult a physician if ingestion occurs. Not meant for wrapping around living creatures. Avoid fire warm areas.
